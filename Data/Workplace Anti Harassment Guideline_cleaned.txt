In order to create such working environment, it is vital to ensure that the workplace is free from all forms of discrimination, including harassment. Wherever harassment occurs, in workplace or anywhere else, it violates human rights. An act of harassment means failure to sustain professional standards. When people get harassed at workplaces, it affects the working environment greatly. It hampers the commitment of employees to work and slows down the process of development in general. bKash respects the personal dignity, privacy and personal rights of every employee and is committed to maintaining a workplace free from discrimination and harassment. SCOPE This ‘Workplace Anti-Harassment Guideline’ provides an overview of workplace harassment, outlines options for dealing with conflicts and provides details on the formal resolution process. This guideline is not meant to interfere with everyday work interactions where some debates or arguments are usual. All of those who work for bKash have a responsibility to ensure a working environment in which the dignity of all employees, vendors and visitors is respected. WORKPLACE HARASSMENT Harassment is a course of conduct directed towards a specific person that causes substantial emotional distress in such person and serves no legitimate purpose. It can be words, gestures, and actions which tend to annoy, alarm and abuse another person. In other words, harassment is unwanted or unwelcome behavior which is meant to or has the effect of either violating a person’s dignity, or creating an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. Unwanted behavior can include (but is not limited to) following examples: ▪ Spoken or written words; ▪ Threats or abuse; ▪ Offensive emails, tweets or comments on social networking sites; ▪ Physical behavior including physical gestures and facial expressions; ▪ Jokes, teasing, and pranks. KEY FORMS OF HARASSMENT ▪ Psychological harassment; ▪ Physical harassment; ▪ Sexual harassment. Page 4 of 7 PSYCHOLOGICAL HARASSMENT Psychological harassment means any vexatious behavior that, in the form of conduct, verbal comments, actions or gestures, affect a person’s dignity or psychological state adversely. Psychological harassment is characterized by the following criterion: ▪ These are repetitive; ▪ These are hostile or unwanted; ▪ These affect the person’s dignity or psychological integrity, and ▪ These result in a harmful work environment. Examples of unacceptable behaviour that are covered by this guideline include (but not limited to): ▪ Bullying or insulting someone by making demeaning comments or jokes; ▪ Demeaning someone by making any comments on his/her appearance, race, age, disability, religion etc.; ▪ Spreading malicious rumours about someone; ▪ Mocking someone’s accent or making stereotypical comments or using offensive nicknames; ▪ Unprofessionally criticizing someone, setting him/her up to fail, or making threats about someone's job security; ▪ Isolation or non-cooperation at work or deliberately excluding someone from social activities involving the immediate work group. PHYSICAL HARASSMENT Physical harassment is also known as workplace violence which refers to the type of workplace harassment that involves physical confrontations. In extreme cases, physical harassment may be classified as assault. Common behaviors include: ▪ Physical attacks (hitting, shoving, kicking); ▪ Cornering a person; ▪ Destroying property to intimidate; ▪ Patting or stroking; ▪ Brushing up against the body; ▪ Invading another’s personal space. Physical gestures such as playful shoving may blur the line between appropriate or not since it is the person on the receiving end who decides whether the behavior makes them uncomfortable. SEXUAL HARASSMENT Sexual harassment is an act or activity which involves either mental or physical sexual domination, or humiliation. It can happen to both women and men, which is always unexpected and unacceptable. Generally, any employee can be a victim of sexual harassment; nonetheless women face it more frequently. Page 5 of 7 Sexual harassment refers to any objectionable behavior of sexual nature or any other behavior based on person’s gender that undermines the dignity of the person. It includes any unwelcome verbal, visual, or physical conduct of a sexual nature that is severe or pervasive and affects working conditions or creates an unfavorable work environment. All the following behaviors can be considered as sexual harassment: ▪ Unwelcome sexually determined behavior (whether directly or by implication) as physical contact and advances; ▪ Attempts or efforts to establish physical relation having sexual implication by abuse of administrative, authoritative or professional powers; ▪ Sexually colored verbal representation; ▪ Demand or request for sexual favors; ▪ Sharing sexually suggestive written, recorded or electronic messages (SMS, email, etc.), including pornographic photo or videos; ▪ Sexually colored remark or gesture; ▪ Indecent gesture, teasing through abusive language, stalking, joking having sexual implication; ▪ Sharing letters, telephone calls, cell phone calls, SMS, pottering, notice, cartoon, writing on table, chair, desk area, walls of office and washroom having sexual implication or insult; ▪ Taking still or video photographs for the purpose of blackmailing and character assassination; ▪ Preventing participation in sports, cultural, organizational and academic activities on the ground of sex and/or for the purpose of sexual harassment; ▪ Making love proposal and exerting pressure or posing threats in case of refusal to love proposal; ▪ Attempt to establish sexual relation by intimidation, deception or false assurance. PROCEEDINGS bKash believes that the people who commit this offensive action and the people who do not protest or prevent it are equally responsible. bKash considers any type of harassment as an unacceptable, indecent and inexcusable offense. bKash is committed to prevent and eliminate such acts. Harassment is no longer considered only as a matter of concern of the Human Resource Division of any organization. As it is also a violation of human rights, each and every staff of bKash has to play a pro-active role in its elimination.
